### Exercice 5 : getting old

Update the LivingBeing entity
    - Add a new property age, with a random value from 0-20 and with a set_age method
    - Update make_living_beings_spend_some_time() method in enclosure_service to check for too old living beings
    - Update tests cases
    - Update daily report to add the age of livingbeings


### Exercice 6 : let's them breed
Create a new method in enclosure_service to handle breeding logic:
    - If an animal is not starving:
        => If another from same specie and different gender exist, they make a new baby (random gender, same specie and 0 days old)

        !! : Pay attention to an already engaged in breeding couple. If a male lion goes to see a female, the same female does not need to look for a male lion.
            => Manage a list of already involved animals

    - if a plant has at leats 10 LP:
        It separate in two same plants with half of its LPs but same age (eg : a 12LP seaweed gives 2 6LPs seawed)
        
    - Update tests cases
    - Update daily report to newborns

# Excercie 7 & 8 : data persistence and log report
We should be able to save and load data from/to a file.
Let's use yaml file for that
    Lib to install and use : pyyaml

We will then create a enclosure repository file with two new methods load_from_file() and save_from_file()

For logging reports, we could write to file every time report_enclosure_state() is called

What left :
    -> Add a readme.md file  âœ…
    -> Write tests
