# Followup exercice 1

- Let's continue with the Enclosure entity class.
- Now write the service class for the enclosure actions :
    - Move forward in time (and related actions)
    - Reporting
        * To report list of animais, group them by name and gender.
- Write tests
- Build an interactive menu. First tests ^^
- Seems fine for now for this exercise 1. Commit and move on

# Excercie 2 : Biodiversity

Sounds like the name attribute for a living being does not represent its specie.
The specie attribute only comes up now with the biodiversity concept.
We do then have now two more attributes for the Animal Entity : the diet and the specie

=> Update Animal Entity class and tests
