### Followup exercice 2

Introducing the Animal entity object and give it the eat ability.
Should test according its diet that an animal gets the correct food
    -> write tests for this

### Excercice 3
    Jungle time ! : With passing days, animals can eat each other..
    -> when an animal got eaten, the state should move to DEAD

    Set the feeding logic in the enclosure service, which will make use of each animal eat() method

    !!! Questions : Have to be settled for the logic 
        * what if an animal has nothing to eat ? => Sadly he dies... 
        * What to do with dead animals or plants ? => Remove them at the end of the day


    Should also add a set_state() set_animals() and set_plants methods() on the enclosure entity class. Those methods would allow us to setup an enclosure easily after every living being eats. They will also be useful for data persistence.
