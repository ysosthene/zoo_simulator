### Followup exercice 3
 -> Update the entity tests case for this
 -> Write some tests cases for let_animals_eat() service

# Excercie 4 : Points de vie

Add the new attribute to LifeBeing class and update the tests accordingly
Update the eating process :
    - An animal eats only when it has less than 5 LP
    - When an animal eats another animal, he gets 5 LP
    - When an animal got eaten, it looses 4 LP
    - If it is an herbivorous, when it eats it gets 4 LP
    - When a plant is eaten it looses 2 PV

Add also another layer (probably before the eating process):
    - Day after day a Plant gets 1PV
    - Day after day, an animal looses 1PV

Write some tests cases for this.

Need also to update the report for a better read experience
